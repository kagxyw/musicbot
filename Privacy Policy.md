Privacy Policy

Introduction:
Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect from you when you use the Music Bot and how it is used and protected.

1. Data Collection:
The only data we collect are:
- The server on which the bot is operating.
- The music being played by the bot (the name, artist, and YouTube link).
We do not collect any personally identifiable information, nor do we store your personal data.

2. Data Usage:
The data we collect is only used for the operation of the bot. This includes enabling the bot to search YouTube for music and ensure smooth playback. No data is shared with third parties.

3. Data Retention:
We do not retain any personal information about users. The only data we retain is related to the server the bot is on and the music being played, which is required for the bot to function properly.

4. Security:
We take reasonable measures to protect the data collected, but please note that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.

5. Third-party Services:
The bot uses YouTube's API to search and play music. By using the bot, you agree to comply with YouTube's own terms of service and privacy policy.

6. Changes to this Policy:
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
